Course project:

Pick one data set, please try your best to build a model such that the prediction error measured by mean-square error or misclassification rate is minimized. Please use cross-validation (will be covered in section 5) to assess the performance of your model.

Data set 1 (regression):

The data set contains X and y separately as text files. Here n=2000 and p=10000.

Data set 2 (binary classification):

Please check test.r in the folder to generate X and y. Here n=122 and p=16384.

Data set 3:

You could also use other data sets, but approval from the instructor is needed.

 * You could either work by yourself or in a group of no more than two.
 * Each group should do a short presentation on Dec 1st and submit a single write up (with code attached) due at Dec 6th. The grading of this problem depends on the following factors: (1) The explanation of the way you choose your model; (2) Whether your model is correctly evaluated. (3) The performance of your model. You are allowed to call packages, e.g., glmnet, random forest.
 * Please let me know your choice of teammates once it is decided.
